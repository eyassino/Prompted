# Prompted

This is a social deduction game where you have to find out which player is the one with the odd prompt

## Gameplay

Each player submits a prompt, and at round start a random prompt will be picked, everyone except the imposter will get the same prompt.

Players must figure out which player got the imposter prompt.

There can be rounds where there are a random amount of imposters or none at all, so watch out!
